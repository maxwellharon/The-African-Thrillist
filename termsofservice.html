      Your safety is our priority
Creating a world where anyone can truly belong requires a foundation of trust grounded in consistent expectations of host and guest behavior. We’ve established these Community Standards to help guide behavior and codify the values that underpin our community.

This is a living document, as we’re constantly refining our approach to meet the needs of our community. But these five standards—safety, security, fairness, authenticity, and reliability—remain central pillars in our efforts to help ensure safety and foster belonging. We’re always working to make sure they’re upheld and enforced.


Safety
Your African Thrillist experience begins the moment you embrace adventure. That’s only possible when you trust this community and feel safe. As a result, we require that you refrain from endangering or threatening anyone.
•
Harming yourself or others
You should not commit physical or sexual assault, sexual abuse, sexual harassment, domestic violence, robbery, human trafficking, other acts of violence, or hold anyone against their will. Members of dangerous organizations, including terrorist, organized criminal, and violent racist groups, are not welcome in this community. The African Thrillist is committed to working with law enforcement as appropriate and responding to valid law enforcement requests.

We take suicide, self-injury, eating disorders, and hard drug abuse extremely seriously and work to help people in crisis.
•
Threatening anyone
You should not convey an intent to harm anyone by your words or physical actions. We also take threats of self-harm as seriously as we do actions and may intervene if we become aware of a threat.
•
Creating hazardous situations
You should not keep unsecured weapons, disease risks, or dangerous animals in your listing, nor should you create conditions that increase the likelihood of a fire or impede escape in the event of emergency.


Security
Our The African Thrillist community members share their homes, neighborhoods, and experiences. Whether you’re opening your home as a host or experiencing a host’s hospitality as a guest, you should trust that you will feel secure. We ask you to respect others’ property, information, and personal belongings.

•
Theft, vandalism, or extortion
You should not take property that isn’t yours, use someone’s property without their permission, copy others’ keys or identity documents, damage others’ property, remain in listings after a stay is concluded, or threaten anyone with bad ratings or any other penalty or harm to obtain compensation or other benefits.

•
Spam, phishing, or fraud
You should not make transactions outside of The African Thrillist’s payments system; commit booking fraud, credit card fraud, or launder money; attempt to drive traffic to other sites or market unrelated products; divert payments meant for others; abuse our referrals system; or make false claims against other members of the community.
•
Violating others’ privacy or intellectual property rights
You should not spy on other people; cameras are not allowed in your listing unless they are previously disclosed and visible, and they are never permitted in private spaces (such as bathrooms or sleeping areas). You should not access others’ accounts without authorization or violate others’ privacy, copyrights, or trademarks.


Fairness
The African Thrillist community is as diverse, unique, and vibrant as the world around us. Fairness is what holds us together, what makes it possible for us to trust one another, integrate seamlessly within communities, and feel as if can we can truly belong.

•
Discriminatory behavior or hate speech
You should treat everyone with respect in every interaction. So, you should follow all applicable laws and not treat others differently because of their race, ethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, sexual orientation, sex, gender, gender identity, disability, or serious diseases. Similarly, insulting others on these bases is not allowed.

•
Bullying or harassing others
You should not share personal information to shame or blackmail others, target others with unwanted behavior, defame others, or violate our review and content standards.
•
Disturbing the surrounding community
You should not disturb common spaces, treat neighbors as “front desk staff,” create a pervasive nuisance for those around you, or persistently fail to respond to neighbor or community concerns.




Authenticity
Your African Thrillist experiences should be full of delightful moments and surprising adventures. Since our community is built on trust, authenticity is essential—it requires a balance of shared expectations, honest interactions, and accurate details.
•
Misrepresenting yourself
You should not provide a false name or date of birth, use listings for commercial purposes without your host’s permission, have events or parties without your host’s approval, maintain duplicate accounts, or create an account if you’re under 18.
•
Misrepresenting your spaces
You should not provide inaccurate location information, have incorrect availability, mislead people about the type, nature, or details of your listing, substitute one listing for another, set up fake or fraudulent listings, leave fraudulent reviews, engage in deceptive pricing, or fail to disclose hazards and habitability issues.
•
Experiences that are merely transactions
The African Thrillist began as a way to allow people to share their homes. Though The African Thrillist has grown since the early days, and home sharing has expanded around the world, we still expect that every listing is not just a transaction, but a place for others to belong.


Reliability
Every The African Thrillist experience is unique and each detail specific to a home, a neighborhood, and a host. Since our community makes commitments based on these details, we have to be able to trust each other’s reliability—whether it be in timely communication, the condition of the home, or in the expectations we set.
•
Providing uninhabitable spaces
You should not provide spaces with sub-standard cleanliness or undisclosed lack of running water or electricity. You should not provide spaces that are not legitimate sleeping quarters (e.g. camping gear), not stationary for the duration of the stay (e.g. moving boats), or lack access to dedicated restroom facilities (e.g. directing guests to use public bathrooms).
•
Breaking commitments
Absent extenuating circumstances, you should not cancel after the deadline set in the relevant cancellation policy. You should also not fail to make check-in possible, fail to pay, or break the host’s house rules.
•
Being unresponsive
You should not have persistently and pervasively low ratings, be unresponsive during booking or throughout a stay, fail to provide an adequate point of contact for hosting, or refuse to participate in our resolution process.
